# Act: Dashboard Grade Card Filter Navigation

## 1. Final Summary
Management efficiency has been improved by connecting high-level dashboard metrics with low-level member management details. Admins can now move from "insight" to "action" with a single click.

## 2. Recommended Next Steps
- **Persistent Filters**: Consider persisting other filters (search term, status) in the URL as well for better shareability.
- **Breadcrumbs**: Implement breadcrumbs to help admins navigate back to the dashboard easily.
- **Visual Cues**: Add a small "active filter" badge near the filter dropdown when a grade filter is active to make it obvious.

## 3. Knowledge Item Update
- Documented the pattern for using URL query parameters as the source of truth for page filters.
- Standardized cross-page navigation patterns within the Admin panel.
